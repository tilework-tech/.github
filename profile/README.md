## About us

**Put Claude Code in hyperdrive.**

At Tilework, our coding agents have utterly transformed the way we build. Our goal is to accelerate adoption of coding agents by providing engineering teams easy tools to customize how their agents work - so coding agents perfectly match the unique preferencies, policies, and skills of users. 

We understand the detailed configuration options available across Coding Agents, packaging them for easy consumption by users.

## Nori

Nori is our package for customizing Claude Code. It comes with 3 core functionalities:

**Documentation**: Automatically create and maintain `docs.md` files throughout your codebase. Server-side knowledge base (paid) with conversation capture, memorize/recall tools, and multi-strategy search.

**Tests**: Enforce TDD with red-green-refactor cycles, systematic debugging frameworks, and mandatory verification. No shortcuts, no unverified claims.

**Profiles**: Pre-built profiles for senior engineers, product managers, and documenters. Switch with one commandâ€”get role-appropriate behavior instantly.
